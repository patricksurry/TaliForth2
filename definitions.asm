; First version: 01. Apr 2016 (Liara Forth)
; This version: 21. Apr 2024

; This file is included by taliforth.asm. These are the general
; definitions; platform-specific definitions such as the
; memory map are kept in the platform folder.

; TaliForth reserves the first part of zero page ($0 - zpage_end) which is
; configured by zpage_end in platform/platform-*.asm and normally 128 bytes.
; The rest of zero page is free for kernel/external use (zpage_end+1 - $FF)
; TaliForth usage is as follows:
;   zero page variables: 30 words = 60 bytes ($0000-$0038)
;   Forth Data Stack: 128 - 60 - 8 = 60 bytes or 30 words
;   Data Stack floodplain: 8 bytes after stack (to avoid catastrophic underflow)

; ZERO PAGE ADDRESSES/VARIABLES

; These are kept at the top of Zero Page, with the most important variables at
; the top because the Data Stack grows towards this area from dsp0: If there is
; an overflow, the lower, less important variables will be clobbered first,
; giving the system a chance to recover. In other words, they are part of the
; overflow floodplain.

; This table defines all of the zero page variables along with their initial
; values except the uninitialized temporaries at the end.  This table
; is relocated to zero page by COLD.

; Loop control data

loopctrl:   .byte ?         ; Offset and flags for DO/LOOP/+LOOP control.
loopidx0    .byte ?         ; cached LSB of current loop index for LOOP (not +LOOP)

lcbstack = $100
loopindex = lcbstack+0      ; loop control block index for adjusted loopindex
loopfufa  = lcbstack+2      ; loop control block offset for limit fudge factor

    ; Each loop needs two control words (loopindex and loopfufa)
    ; which are stored in a 4-byte (dword) loop control block (LCB).
    ; Remembering state across nested loops means we need a stack of LCBs.
    ; A traditional Forth stores these blocks directly on the return stack
    ; but it's simpler for us to use a separate stack.
    ; This requires the same storage but is easier for us to manage.
    ; We use the space underneath the return stack with our stack
    ; growing upward towards it, but the specific location is arbitrary.
    ; The loopctrl byte is our loop stack pointer with current LCB offset.
    ; The loopidx0 byte caches the LSB of the current loopindex
    ; which helps us avoid some indexed operations.
    ;
    ; Here's how the various loop words interact to manage the loop:
    ;
    ; DO adds 4 to loopctrl to assign the next LCB.
    ; It writes the initial values of loopindex and loopfufa to the LCB and
    ; copies the LSB of loopindex to loopidx0
    ;
    ; LOOP usually just increments the LSB in loopidx0, avoiding the LCB
    ; altogether unless the LSB overflows.
    ;
    ; +LOOP updates loopidx0 and (if needed) the loopindex MSB. it can
    ; also avoid some checks if we have no carry and the step is < 256
    ;
    ; UNLOOP subtracts 4 from loopctrl to drop the current LCB.
    ; it restores LSB of the now current loopindex to loopidx0
    ; so that any enclosing loop has the correct value
    ;
    ; the I and J words use 16bit math to calculate the index from the LCB
    ; I can use loopidx0 for the LSB of loopindex
