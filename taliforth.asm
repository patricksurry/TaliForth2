; HEADER HELPER FUNCTIONS
;
; These functions help navigate the variable size headers.
; Currently nt_to_nt is a subroutine that's shared by several callers.
; In the current test suite this is called about 2M times
; in find_nt_by_name (during parsing), and another 100K times
; in find_nt_by_xt (mostly by compile,).
; Inlining nt_to_nt in the find_nt_by_name variant would save about 25M cycles
; (about 14% of the test suite cycles) but this is only a compile time expense
; so might not be worth it for "real" forth code.
; An alternative would be a simple cache of recently used words.

                ; to watch (tmp1)+1 for a length byte >= 32.  For example:
