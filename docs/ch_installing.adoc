=== Downloading

Tali Forth 2 lives on GitHub(((GitHub))) at
https://github.com/SamCoVT/TaliForth2. This is where you will always
find the current version. You can either clone the code with
git(((git))) or simply download it. To just test Tali Forth using the
py65mon simulator, all you need is the binary file
`taliforth-py65mon.bin`.

=== Running 

Tali currently supports two simulators, py65mon and c65.  Py65mon will need to
be downloaded separately (see below) and c65 comes with Tali in the c65
folder.  If you have `gcc` and `make` installed, you can just type (in the
main Tali folder):

[source,bash]
----
make csim
----

This will compile the c65 simulator (if it hasn't been compiled yet) and run
Tali Forth 2 in the simulator.

To exit, you can type `bye` or use CTRL-C to break out of the simulator.

Note: If running on Windows in a git bash shell, you will need to use winpty,
eg. `winpty make csim`.  This is only needed for the git bash shell.  Running
Tali in c65 from the Windows command prompt or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
works fine.

==== Downloading the py65mon Simulator

Tali was written to run out of the box on the py65mon simulator from
https://github.com/mnaberez/py65.(((py65mon))) This is a Python(((Python)))
program that should run on various operating systems. Py65mon is also required
for the test suite.

To install py65mon on Linux(((Linux))), use one of the following commands

[source,bash]
----
# Install for only your user:
pip install -U py65 --user

# Install for all users:
sudo pip install -U py65
----

If you don't have `pip`(((pip))) installed, you will have to add it first with
something like `sudo apt-get install python-pip` (Ubuntu Linux).  Some systems
use pip3 and you can run the above commands with pip3 instead of pip.

If you are on windows, you will need to download and install Python 3
first.  Once Python is installed, the above commands should work from
a Windows command prompt.


==== Running the Binary

To start the emulator, run:

[source,bash]
----
py65mon -m 65c02 -r taliforth-py65mon.bin
----

Note that the option `-m 65c02` is required, because Tali Forth makes extensive
use of the additional commands of the CMOS version and will not run on a stock
6502 MPU.  If you have `make` installed

If you downloaded the full Tali Forth 2 source code and have `make`
installed, you can also just type:

[source,bash]
----
make sim
----

to run Tali Forth 2 in the py65mon simulator (it will run the above
command for you).

=== Installing on Your Own Hardware

The Tali Forth project started out as a way to run Forth on my own 65c02
computer, the Übersquirrel(((Übersquirrel))). Though it soon developed a life of
its own, a central aim of the project is to provide a working, modern Forth that
people can install on their projects.

==== The Platform Files

For this to work, you need to go to the `platform` folder and create your own
kernel(((kernel))) code to replace `platform-py65mon.asm`, the default kernel
for use with the py65mon(((py65mon))) kernel. By convention, the name should
start with `platform-`. See the `README.md` file in the the `platform` folder
for details.

Once you have configured your platform file in the plaform folder, you
can build a binary (typically programmed into an EEPROM) for your
hardware with make.  If you made a platform file named
`platform-mycomp.asm`, then you should `cd` to the main Tali folder 
and run

[source,bash]
----
make taliforth-mycomp.bin
----

The bin file will be created in the main folder.  You should, of
course, replace the "mycomp" portion of that command with whatever you
named your platform.

=== Hardware Projects with Tali Forth 2

This is a list of projects known to run Tali Forth 2. Please let me know if you
want to have your project added to the list.
