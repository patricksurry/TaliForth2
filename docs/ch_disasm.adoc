Tali Forth is currently shipped with a very primitive disassembler, which is
started with `disasm ( addr u -- )`. 

==== Format

The output format is in Simpler Assembler Notation (SAN). Briefly, the
instruction's mode is added to the mnemonic, leaving the operand a pure number.
For use in a postfix environment like Tali Forth, the operand is listed _before_
the mnemonic. This way, traditional assembly code such as

----
LDA #1
DEC
STA $1000
STA $80
NOP
LDA ($80)
----

becomes (assuming `hex` for hexadecimal numbers):

----
        1 lda.#
          dec.a
     1000 sta
       80 sta.z
          nop
       80 lda.zi
----

See the Appendix for a more detailed discussion of the format. 


==== Output

The disassembler prints the address of the instruction, followed by any operand
and the mnemonic. To get the code of `drop`, for instance, we can use 
`' drop 6 disasm`:

----
36142  55337 jsr     STACK DEPTH CHECK
36145        inx
36146        inx
36147        rts
----

The Forth word `see` calls the disassembler while using a hexadecimal number
base. So `see drop` produces: 

----
nt: BC3E  xt: 8D2E 
flags (CO AN IM NN UF HC): 0 0 0 0 1 0 
size (decimal): 5 

8D2E  20 29 D8 E8 E8   )...

8D2E   D829 jsr     STACK DEPTH CHECK
8D31        inx
8D32        inx
----

Note that `see` does not print the final `rts` instruction.

==== Determining address labels

When disassembling, using either `disasm` or `see`, the dictionary is searched
anytime a `jsr` is encountered and the name of the word will be printed if a
word with that address is found.  Some interal routines in Tali are not in the
Forth dictionary and so no name will be printed.  Here is an example when running
`see order`

----
nt: C9FF  xt: 9845 
flags (CO AN IM NN UF HC): 0 0 0 0 0 0 
size (decimal): 42 

9845  20 63 89 20 34 91 B5 00  F0 1E A8 E8 E8 B5 00 5A   c. 4... .......Z
9855  20 70 98 7A 88 D0 F4 20  1E A1 20 1E A1 20 29 91   p.z...  .. .. ).
9865  B5 00 20 70 98 20 63 89  E8 E8  .. p. c. ..

9845   8963 jsr     cr
9848   9134 jsr     get-order
984B      0 lda.zx
984D     1E beq
984F        tay
9850        inx
9851        inx
9852      0 lda.zx
9854        phy
9855   9870 jsr     
9858        ply
9859        dey
985A     F4 bne
985C   A11E jsr     space
985F   A11E jsr     space
9862   9129 jsr     get-current
9865      0 lda.zx
9867   9870 jsr     
986A   8963 jsr     cr
986D        inx
986E        inx
----

This word is a mixture of assembly and other forth words.  Note that the second
to last jsr shows a destination address of 9870 (in hex).  To trace this
further, consult the labelmap for your platform in the /docs folder.  In this
case, searching for 9870 in the labelmap finds the following label and the
assembly files can be searched to locate this routine if you need to see its
source.

----
order_print_wid_string= $9870
----

==== Literals and Strings

Tali compiles literals into words by saving a jsr to a helper
routine followed immediately by the data for the literal.  During
disassembly, the literal value will be printed and the disassembler will resume
disassembling from just after the literal value.  Doubles are saved in memory as
two single cell literal values.

Strings are similar, however they are saved in memory as a jmp over the string
data, then the string data, then a jsr to the string handling routine, and
finally the address and length of the string (similar to how literals are
handled).  When the disassembler encounters a string, it will print SLITERAL
followed by the address and length of the string.
----
: example s" This is a string" ;  ok
see example 
nt: 800  xt: 80F 
flags (CO AN IM NN UF HC): 0 0 0 1 0 1 
size (decimal): 26 

080F  4C 22 08 54 68 69 73 20  69 73 20 61 20 73 74 72  L".This  is a str
081F  69 6E 67 20 A9 A0 12 08  10 00  ing .... ..

80F    822 jmp
822   A0A9 jsr     SLITERAL 812 10 
 ok
----
To see the value of the string, you can either look at the memory dump above the
disassembly or you can `type` the string yourself (note that `see` will always
give the values in hex while `disasm` will use the current `base`):
----
hex 812 10 type
----

==== Gotchas and known issues

Tali Forth enforces the *signature byte* of the `brk` assembler instruction.
That is, it is treated like a two-byte instruction. Since you probably shouldn't be 
using `brk` anyway, this behavior is usually only interesting when examing the
code, where a block of zeros will produce something like the following with the
disassembler:

----
124B      0 brk
124D      0 brk
124F      0 brk
1251      0 brk
----

Because of the stack structure of Forth, the disassembler will not catch
assembler instructions that were *assigned an operand by mistake*. Take this
(broken) code:

----
nop
10 dex  <1>
nop
rts
----
<1> Error: DEX does not take an operand!

The disassembler will output this code (addresses might vary):
----
4661        nop
4662        dex  <1>
4663        nop
4664        rts
----
<1> Incorrect operand for DEX was silently ignored

The 10 we had passed as an operand are still on the stack, as `.s` will show. A
`dump` of the code will show that the number was ignored, leading to code that
will actually run correctly (again, addresses will vary):

----
1235  EA CA EA 60
----

These mistakes can surface further downstream when the incorrect value on the
Data Stack causes problems.
