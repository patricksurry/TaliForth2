Tali Forth is currently shipped with a very primitive disassembler, which is
started with `disasm ( addr u -- )`.

==== Format

The output format is in Simpler Assembler Notation (SAN). Briefly, the
instruction's mode is added to the mnemonic, leaving the operand a pure number.
For use in a postfix environment like Tali Forth, the operand is listed _before_
the mnemonic. This way, traditional assembly code such as

----
LDA #1
DEC
STA $1000
STA $80
NOP
LDA ($80)
----

becomes (assuming `hex` for hexadecimal numbers):

----
        1 lda.#
          dec.a
     1000 sta
       80 sta.z
          nop
       80 lda.zi
----

See the Appendix for a more detailed discussion of the format.


==== Output

The disassembler prints the address of the instruction, followed by any operand
and the mnemonic. To get the code of `drop`, for instance, we can use
`' drop 6 disasm`:

----
36142  55337 jsr     STACK DEPTH CHECK
36145        inx
36146        inx
36147        rts
----

The Forth word `see` calls the disassembler while using a hexadecimal number
base. So `see drop` produces:

----
nt: BC34  xt: 8653
flags: CO 0 IM 0 AN 0 NN 0 HC 0 | UF 1 ST 0
size (decimal): 5

8653  20 B5 D8 E8 E8   ....

8653   D8B5 jsr     1 STACK DEPTH CHECK
8656        inx
8657        inx
----

Note that `see` does not print the final `rts` instruction.

==== Determining address labels

When disassembling, using either `disasm` or `see`, the dictionary is searched
anytime a `jsr` is encountered and the name of the word will be printed if a
word with that address is found.  Some interal routines in Tali are not in the
Forth dictionary and so no name will be printed.  Here is an example when running
`see order`

----
nt: CA31  xt: B31A
flags: CO 0 IM 0 AN 0 NN 0 HC 0 | UF 0 ST 0
size (decimal): 42

B31A  20 EC 83 20 EA B2 B5 00  F0 1E A8 E8 E8 B5 00 5A   .. .... .......Z
B32A  20 45 B3 7A 88 D0 F4 20  B3 91 20 B3 91 20 DF B2   E.z...  .. .. ..
B33A  B5 00 20 45 B3 20 EC 83  E8 E8  .. E. .. ..

B31A   83EC jsr     cr
B31D   B2EA jsr     get-order
B320      0 lda.zx
B322     1E beq     B342 v
B324        tay
B325        inx
B326        inx
B327      0 lda.zx
B329        phy
B32A   B345 jsr
B32D        ply
B32E        dey
B32F     F4 bne     B325 ^
B331   91B3 jsr     space
B334   91B3 jsr     space
B337   B2DF jsr     get-current
B33A      0 lda.zx
B33C   B345 jsr
B33F   83EC jsr     cr
B342        inx
B343        inx
----

This word is a mixture of assembly and other forth words.  Note that the second
to last jsr shows a destination address of 9870 (in hex).  To trace this
further, consult the labelmap for your platform in the /docs folder.  In this
case, searching for 9870 in the labelmap finds the following label and the
assembly files can be searched to locate this routine if you need to see its
source.

----
order_print_wid_string= $9870
----

==== Literals and Strings

Tali compiles literals into words by saving a jsr to a helper
routine followed immediately by the data for the literal.  During
disassembly, the literal value will be printed and the disassembler will resume
disassembling from just after the literal value.  Doubles are saved in memory as
two single cell literal values.

Strings are similar, they are saved in memory as a jsr to the string handling routine,
then the string length and inline string data (similar to how literals are
handled).  When the disassembler encounters a string, it will print SLITERAL
followed by the length of the string and a snippet of the data:
----
: example s" This is a string" ;  ok
see example
nt: 827  xt: 836
flags: CO 0 IM 0 AN 0 NN 0 HC 0 | UF 0 ST 0
size (decimal): 21

0836  20 29 A2 10 00 54 68 69  73 20 69 73 20 61 20 73   )...Thi s is a s
0846  74 72 69 6E 67                                    tring

836   A229 jsr     SLITERAL 10 This is a strin...
 ok
----
To see the value of the string, you can either look at the memory dump above the
disassembly or you can `type` the string yourself (note that `see` will always
give the values in hex while `disasm` will use the current `base`):
----
hex 836 5 + 10 cr type
This is a string ok
----

==== Gotchas and known issues

Tali Forth enforces the *signature byte* of the `brk` assembler instruction.
That is, it is treated like a two-byte instruction. Since you probably shouldn't be
using `brk` anyway, this behavior is usually only interesting when examing the
code, where a block of zeros will produce something like the following with the
disassembler:

----
124B      0 brk
124D      0 brk
124F      0 brk
1251      0 brk
----

Because of the stack structure of Forth, the disassembler will not catch
assembler instructions that were *assigned an operand by mistake*. Take this
(broken) code:

----
nop
10 dex  <1>
nop
rts
----
<1> Error: DEX does not take an operand!

The disassembler will output this code (addresses might vary):
----
4661        nop
4662        dex  <1>
4663        nop
4664        rts
----
<1> Incorrect operand for DEX was silently ignored

The 10 we had passed as an operand are still on the stack, as `.s` will show. A
`dump` of the code will show that the number was ignored, leading to code that
will actually run correctly (again, addresses will vary):

----
1235  EA CA EA 60
----

These mistakes can surface further downstream when the incorrect value on the
Data Stack causes problems.
