# Platform configurations for Tali Forth 2

First version: 17. Oct 2018
This version: 27. Jun 2025

This folder contains platform-specific configurations for building Tali Forth 2.
Each configuration is in its own folder in a file named platform.asm.
The default configuration for testing with the py65 emulator is
`py65mon/platform.asm`.   A similar configuration supporting external block
IO with the c65 emulator is `c65/platform.asm`.   These both assume a memory layout
with at least 32Kb of ROM.  The `minimal/platform.asm` configuration strips out
a number of optional features to run in 12-16Kb of ROM.

Other platforms are included to make life easier for individual developers,
along with `skeleton/platform.asm` as a template for people who want to port Tali to their own hardware.
Those not mentioned above may not be up to date with the latest changes: *caveat emptor*.

A platform file is simply a [64tass](https://tass64.sourceforge.net/)
`.asm` file that customizes Tali's memory layout and feature set by
overriding default parameters.  The configuration then includes the global
`taliforth.asm` and finally defines the basic I/O routines that Tali uses
to get and put characters.  The configuration can optionally include platform-specific
words written in either assembly or Forth.

By default the top-level `make` will build `taliforth-py65mon.bin`.
To build for a different platform simply specify the name of the platform
folder.  For example build a 16K image with:

    make minimal

This will use the configuration defined in `platforms/minimal/platform.asm`
and produce a binary called `taliforth-minimal.bin` at the top level
along with listing and label (symbol) files in the platform folder.

If the platform supports multiple variants---for example
one version that runs on the c65 simulator and one for physical 
hardware---specify the VARIANT name in the make command:  

    make uc VARIANT=c65

This will produce a binary called `taliforth-uc-c65.bin`.

## Creating or modifying a configuration

To get starting creating your own configuration, it is recommended that you
create your own folder in the platform directory and copy the files from
the skeleton platform into it.  These are heavily commented on what your
options are and what you need to do.  The main configuration will be in the
`platform.asm` file in your folder.

The configuration has these responsibilities:

1. Customize the memory layout.  Where does RAM end and ROM begin?  What
   should be reserved for Tali or your own use?

2. Which Tali Forth 2 features should be included?

3. Provide the I/O routines `kernel_init`, `kernel_bye`, `kernel_getc`, `kernel_putc`
   and `kernel_kbhit` (optional), along with the `s_kernel_id` string to show on startup.

4. Define the 65c02 reset and interrupt vectors at $fffa-$ffff, if needed.

5. (optional) If your platform supports multiple variants, use conditional assembly
   based on the `VARIANT` symbol, e.g. `.if VARIANT="c65" ... .endif`.

### Tali Forth 2 memory layout

Tali's memory usage is highly configurable although you probably won't need to
change much at first.  See "Memory map" in the Developer's Guide for further discussion.
The diagram below sketches how Tali uses memory.
Note: it's not only ugly, but also not to scale.
The addresses shown on the left refer to the standard py65mon/c65 configuration.
You can modify for your needs by customizing the variables shown on the right.

As you can see in the skeleton platform.asm,
you likely only need to define ram_end and choose the starting location
for Tali's ROM code.

(Note for developers: some of the py65/c65 defaults are hard-coded in
the testing routines, particularly the size of the input history buffer, the
offset for PAD, and the total RAM size. If these defaults are changed, the tests will
have to be changed as well.)

### Optional features

Tali Forth 2 is a bit of a beast, expecting about 24K of ROM space for all features.
For some applications, the user might not need certain words and would
prefer to have the memory back instead.  If you define the list
TALI_OPTIONAL_WORDS then only those features will be
assembled.  If TALI_OPTIONAL_WORDS is not defined in your platform file,
you will get everything.
```
TALI_OPTIONAL_WORDS := [
    "ed", "editor", "ramdrive", "block",
    "environment?", "assembler", "disassembler", "wordlist"
]
```
The currently available groups are:

- `ed` is a string editor. (~1.5K)
- `editor` is a block editor. The EDITOR-WORDLIST will also be removed. (~0.25K)
- `ramdrive` is for testing block words without a block device. (~0.3K)
- `block` is the optional BLOCK words. (~1.4K)
- `facility` is a partial implementation of the FACILITY word set for ANS-compatible terminals. 
   It currently contains PAGE and AT-XY.  
   If you're implementing for custom hardware you'll likely need to exclude this and
   implement these words yourself.
- `environment?` is the ENVIRONMENT? word.  While this is a core word
   for ANS-2012, it uses a lot of strings and therefore takes up a lot of memory. (~0.2K)
- `assembler` is a 65c02 assembler.
   The ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST will also be removed if the assembler is removed. (~3K)
- `disassembler` is the disassembler word DISASM. (~0.5K plus assembler)
- `wordlist` is for the optional SEARCH-ORDER words (e.g. wordlists)
   Note: Without "wordlist", you will not be able to use any words from
   the EDITOR or ASSEMBLER wordlists (they should probably be disabled
   by also removing "editor" and "assembler"), and all new words will
   be compiled into the FORTH wordlist. (~0.9K)

You can control what character(s) are printed by the word
CR in order to move the cursor to the next line.  The default is "lf"
for a line feed character (#10).  "cr" will use a carriage return (#13).
Having both will use a carriage return followed by a line feed.  This
only affects output.  Either CR or LF can be used to terminate lines
on the input.
```
TALI_OPTION_CR_EOL := [ "lf" ]
; TALI_OPTION_CR_EOL := [ "cr" ]
; TALI_OPTION_CR_EOL := [ "cr", "lf" ]
```
You can also tell Tali how wide your screen so that it can provide
better multi-line output.  Currently this controls line-wrapping in WORDS
and switches to a narrow implementation of DUMP under 74 columns.
```
TALI_OPTION_MAX_COLS := 80
```
By default Tali provides editable input history buffers via ctrl-n/ctrl-p.
These can be disabled by setting `TALI_OPTION_HISTORY` to 0, saving about ~0.2K of Tali ROM and 1K RAM.
```
TALI_OPTION_HISTORY := 1
; TALI_OPTION_HISTORY := 0      ; disable history
```
Finally, setting `TALI_OPTION_TERSE` to 1 strips or shortens various strings to reduce the memory
footprint, saving about ~0.5K.
```
TALI_OPTION_TERSE := 0
; TALI_OPTION_TERSE := 1        ; shorten/remove strings
```

### Kernel I/O routines

Tali needs platform specific I/O routines to get input from the user
and display output back to them.  It expects the platform configuration
to provide the following kernel routines:

- `kernel_init` Initialize the low-level hardware.  This is normally also
  the reset vector.  It should set up your hardware, print the startup
  message and `jmp forth`.
- `kernel_getc` Get a single character from the keyboard and return
  it in the accumulator.  It should block until a character is ready,
  and should preserve the X and Y registers.
- `kernel_putc` Send the character in A to the output device (e.g. screen).
  It should preserve the X and Y registers, but need not preserve A.
- `kernel_kbhit` Return a non-zero value in the accumulator if an input character
  is ready (i.e. kernel_getc won't block).  It should preserve the X and Y registers.
  This is the only optional routine and a version that always returns true will
  be created if you do not define the label.
- `kernel_bye` Exit forth, e.g. to a monitor program or just `brk` to reset.
- `s_kernel_id` Labels a zero-terminated string to be printed at startup.

You can use the examples in the existing platforms for inspiration as you
configure for your own hardware.

Note that `kernel_kbhit` only returns a flag that a character is ready,
but doesn't actually return the character.  It's only required if you use the KEY? word.
If your hardware requires you to read the character while checking whether one is
ready, you should buffer it and make sure that `kernel_getc` checks the buffer.
(See `py65mon/platform.asm` as one example.)
If your hardware doesn't support kbhit, or you don't care about KEY?,
taliforth.asm will provide a default implementation which always returns true,
so that any subequent call to KEY would block until a key is actually ready.

### Reset and interrupt vectors

Your platform configuration should define the 6502 NMI, Reset and IRQ vectors at
$fffa-$ffff if you are going to boot directly into Tali.  Typically at least
Reset ($fffc) should point to `kernel_init`.  If you are going to load Tali from
another monitor or OS, then you likely do not need to define the vectors.

### Supporting User Interrupt (e.g. Ctrl-C to break)

If your platform has support for hardware interrupts, you can easily
support the ability for a user to stop running (runaway?) code and return to
the input prompt.

For platforms that have an interrupt-driven serial console, this can be
implemented by checking to see if an input character read in the interrupt
service routine is the "break" key (e.g. Ctrl-C). If so, instead of
buffering the input character and returning from the interrupt, set A to
error code `err_usersigint` (see `stringtable.asm`) and jump to Taliforth's
`error` entry point. After printing the "User interrupt" message, Taliforth
will jump to `ABORT` which resets the Forth data stack and the return stack.

Before jumping to `error` you should re-enable interrupts (since no RTI
instruction will be executed), and flush your input buffer so that characters
buffered before the break key was detected will not be processed as new
input when Taliforth next awaits user input.

Any other mechanism that can respond to a hardware input via an interrupt
service routine could be used in a similar manner to allow a user to
interrupt running code and return to the prompt. For example, the 6502's
NMI input could be used with a simple push-button that vectors to code that
jumps to `error` as described above.

## Contributing

To submit your configuration file, pick a name for your platform folder that is
not taken yet and initiate a pull request with it. A few comment lines at the
beginning with some background information would be nice. You'll probably want
to include your own boot string (see the platform_forth.fs file from the
skeleton folder) because that's pretty cool.

Submitting your code implies that you are okay with other people using or
adapting it for their own systems. If your routines contain code for control of
your supervillain hide-out, the Evil League of Evil suggests you keep it off of
GitHub.

Note that this is being provided as a service only. As always, we take no
resposibility for anything, and you'll have to keep an eye on the code
yourself.
