; The main file of Tali got us to about $e000. However, py65mon by default puts
; the basic I/O routines at the beginning of $f000. We don't want to change
; that because it would make using it out of the box harder, so we just
; advance past the virtual hardware addresses.

io_start = $f000

* = io_start

; Define the c65 / py65mon magic IO addresses relative to $f000
