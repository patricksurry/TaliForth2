TALI_OPTIONAL_WORDS := [ "ed", "editor", "ramdrive", "block", "environment?", "assembler", "disassembler", "wordlist" ]

; "ed" is a string editor. (~1.5K)
; "editor" is a block editor. (~0.25K)
;     The EDITOR-WORDLIST will also be removed.
; "ramdrive" is for testing block words without a block device. (~0.3K)
; "block" is the optional BLOCK words. (~1.4K)
; "environment?" is the ENVIRONMENT? word.  While this is a core word
;     for ANS-2012, it uses a lot of strings and therefore takes up a lot
;     of memory. (~0.2K)
; "assembler" is an assembler. (~3.2K)
;     The ASSEMBLER-WORDLIST will also be removed if the assembler is removed.
; "disassembler" is the disassembler word DISASM. (~0.6K)
;     If both the assembler and dissasembler are removed, the tables
;     (used for both assembling and disassembling) will be removed
;     for additional memory savings. (extra ~1.6K)
; "wordlist" is for the optional SEARCH-ORDER words (eg. wordlists)
;     Note: Without "wordlist", you will not be able to use any words from
;     the EDITOR or ASSEMBLER wordlists (they should probably be disabled
;     by also removing "editor" and "assembler"), and all new words will
;     be compiled into the FORTH wordlist. (~0.9K)

    
; TALI_OPTION_CR_EOL sets the character(s) that are printed by the word
; CR in order to move the cursor to the next line.  The default is "lf"
; for a line feed character (#10).  "cr" will use a carriage return (#13).
; Having both will use a carriage return followed by a line feed.  This
; only affects output.  Either carriage returns or line feeds can be used
; to terminate lines on the input.

;TALI_OPTION_CR_EOL := [ "cr" ]
;TALI_OPTION_CR_EOL := [ "cr", "lf" ]

; TALI_OPTION_HISTORY enables editable input history buffers via ctrl-n/ctrl-p
; These buffers are disabled when set to 0 (saving about ~0.2K Tali ROM, 1K RAM)

; TALI_OPTION_TERSE strips or shortens various strings to reduce the memory
