; The user-visible word COMPILE, is defined here along with various
; supporting cmpl_xxx routines.  These generate 65c02 assembler
; instructions from Forth code.  This is a good place to start
; reading if you want to understand how that process works.
;
; We can compile words inline or as JSR calls based on the nc-limit
; variable:  COMPILE, has internal entry points cmpl_by_limit,
; cmpl_inline and cmpl_as_call.  Inline compilation copies the
; source code for a word between xt_<word> and <z_word>,
; optionally removing the initial stack depth check.
; For some words we also discard leading and trailing stack
; juggling based on the ST flag.
;
; A great way to understand what's going on is to write simple
; Forth words and use SEE to disassemble them.  Try different
; values for nc-limit threshold and the strip-underflow flag.
; For example:
;
;       32 nc-limit !
;       true strip-underflow !
;       : fib 0 1 rot 0 ?do over + swap loop drop ;
;       see fib
;
; Forth uses only two branching constructs, an unconditional jump
; and a conditional 0branch.  TaliForth doesn't expose 0BRANCH as
; a user word but see cmpl_jump, cmpl_jump_later, cmpl_jump_tos,
; cmpl_0branch_tos and cmpl_0branch_later.  The xxx_later variants
; let us compile forward references where we need to come back
; and fill in the branch address after we've reached the target.
;
; The conditional zero_branch_runtime is also here.  It has some
; subtlety to support both inline and subroutine forms.
; It's factored into two parts, ztest_runtime and zbranch_runtime.
; Several looping conditional (LOOP, +LOOP, ?DO) implement custom
; tests followed by zbranch_runtime when compiled as subroutines.
; The inline forms are typically much simpler since they can use
; 65c02 jmp and bxx branch opcodes directly.

;TODO does it make sense to have an actual word, like COMPILE-NT, ?

; =====================================================================
; 0BRANCH runtime
;
; TaliForth doesn't expose 0BRANCH directly as a word, but implements
; all conditional branching with this runtime.  It's broken into
; two parts: ztest_runtime checks if TOS is zero,
; and zbranch_runtime then conditionally branches to a target address.
; This allows the looping constructs LOOP, +LOOP and ?DO to implement
; their own custom tests and reuse the zbranch_runtime for branching.
;
; Native compilation is very straightforward: we inline a few bytes
; from ztest_runtime and tack on a BEQ <target> or BNE +3/JMP <target>
; to implement the branch.  Non-native compilation generates
; JSR zero_branch_runtime / .word <target> so the runtime can
; use its own return address to read <target> and either return to
; that address or simply continue beyond the <target> word.
; This is obviously much slower but sometimes space is more
; important than speed.
