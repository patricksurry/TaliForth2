; Disassembler for Tali Forth 2
; Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
; Updated by Sam Colwell and Patrick Surry
; First version: 28. Apr 2018
; This version: 06. Apr 2024

; This is the default disassembler for Tali Forth 2. Use by passing
; the address and length of the block of memory to be disassembled:
;
;       disasm ( addr x -- )

; The underflow checking is handled by the word's stub in words/*.asm, see
; there for more information.

; The code is disassembled in Simpler Assembler Notation (SAN), because that
; is, uh, simpler. See the documentation and https://github.com/scotws/SAN for
; more information. Because disassemblers are used interactively with slow
; humans, we don't care that much about speed and put the emphasis at being
; small.

; Uses: tmp3, tmp2, tmp1 (xt_u_dot_r uses xt_type which uses tmp1)
;       scratch (used for handling literals and JSRs)
