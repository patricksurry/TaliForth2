# Makefile for Tali Forth 2
# This version: 14. Jan 2020

# Notes: The manual is not automatically updated because not everybody
# can be expected to have the asciidoc toolchain and ditaa installed.
# Tali requires python 3.x, 64tass, and GNU make to build the 65C02
# binary image.

# Example uses, where $ is the prompt (yours might be C:\>):
#
# Build tailforth-py65mon.bin for use with the py65mon simulator.
#
#   $ make
#
# Build Taliforth 2 for a different platform (steckschwein shown here).
# There must be a matching platform file in the platform folder.
#
#   $ make taliforth-steckschwein.bin
#
# Run tests
#
#   $ make tests
# or
#   $ make ctests
#
# Build and run Taliforth
#
#   $ make sim
# or
#   $ make csim
#
# The cxxx targets use the C-based c65 simulator rather than the default
# py65mon python simulator.  This runs 10-100x faster but
# lacks py65mon's monitor facilities for debugging.
# c65 should build automatically from the sources in `c65/`.
# It's been tested on posix-based systems like OS X and Windows WSL
# (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
# A native Windows port for mingw is still TODO
# (see https://github.com/SamCoVT/TaliForth2/issues/74).

# Determine which python launcher to use (python3 on Linux and OSX,
# "py -3" on Windows) and other OS-specific commands (rm vs del).
ifdef OS
	RM = del
	PYTHON = py -3
else
	RM = rm -f
	PYTHON = python3
